# Creating and Retrieving a Bot Token

### **Step 1: Create a New Application or Choose an Existing One**
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. You have two options:
   - **Create a New Application**: Click the "New Application" button in the top-right corner, enter a name for your application (this will be your bot’s name), and click "Create".
   - **Choose an Existing Application**: If you already have an application, select it from the list of existing applications.

---

### **Step 2: Retrieving the Bot Token**
1. After creating the bot, go to the "Bot" tab. You’ll see a section called "Token".
2. Click the "Reset" button to reset the bot token.
3. After resetting the token, there should be a "Copy" button. Click that to copy the token to your clipboard.
   - **Important:** Keep this token private. If anyone else gets access to it, they can control your bot.

### **Step 3: Enabling Privileged Gateway Intents**
1. In the same "Bot" tab where you found the token, scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section.
2. Toggle on the "Presence Intent".
